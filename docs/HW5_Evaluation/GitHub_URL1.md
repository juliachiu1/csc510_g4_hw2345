|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member did far less than other teammates)|   ||
|Number of commits|   ||
|Number of commits: by different people|    ||
|Issues reports: |    ||
|Issues are being closed|   ||
|DOI badge: exists|   ||
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly|   ||
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |   ||
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|   ||
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|   ||
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|   ||
|Use of version control tools|    ||
|Use of style checkers |    ||
|Use of code formatters. |    ||
|Use of syntax checkers. |    ||
|Use of code coverage |   ||
|Other automated analysis tools|    ||
|Test cases exist|    ||
|Test cases are routinely executed|   ||
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|    ||
|Issues are discussed before they are closed|   ||
|Chat channel: exists|    ||
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|   ||
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|   ||
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|   ||
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|   ||
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|   ||
|Short release cycles |   ||
